# ICUC-
Inter Connected Universities of California - an app that lets you find UC colleagues.

ICUC is a web app written in Node.JS that allows users to communicate with eachother using Socket.Io
The inital plan was to integrate a machine learning script written in Python, but the software pipeline got a little messy.
Currently the chat bot is in it's own separate Python file. Running the Python script works fine in any terminal.
